# bf2py
## What is this?
A simple compiler that turns [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) in to Python code.

## Why?
bf2py (originally known as jjc, an awful acronym of my old GitHub username and compiler) was written as a bit of coursework for my 2nd Year Computer Science compilers module. While the current code has been cleaned up to meet my more discerning standards, the original code can be seen in the [original branch](). 

##How?
### Usage
bf2py.py input.bf [output.py]
